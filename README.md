# Predicting Yelp Ratings for Restaurants
In this project, I use the Yelp API to put together a dataset containing restaurants from several different cities. I then use this to model the data and predict Yelp ratings using linear regression.

The file labeled "Predicting Yelp Ratings for Restaurants" contains my project where you can see the process for how I cleaned up the data in the project. 

You can also download both the raw data from the API and the clean dataset.
