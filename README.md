# Predicting Yelp Ratings for Restaurants

## Goal
In this project, I will do the following:
- Use the Yelp API to construct a dataset of restaurants in a variety of different cities in the United States.
- Cleaned the dataset.
- Used a linear regression model with K-fold analysis to predict Yelp ratings.

## Data
The dataset was extracted from the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search).

## Results
I provided the raw data, as well as the clean dataset that I used for the project.
After completing K-fold analysis, the model was able to predict ratings that were roughly 1/2 star away from the restaurants' actual rating.
